  Bean
</h1>

Bean is a simple and open source website based on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Strapi](https://strapi.io/). Its mainly focused is to provide a simple, adaptable and scalable structure for both frontend and backend users. Bean is developed at the EPFL, aiming to provide a tool for teaching in the [CAS pour l'enseignement de la Science Informatique en secondaire 1](https://www.epfl.ch/education/educational-initiatives/fr/le-projet-edunum-le-cas-si/cas-si).

_Please note that the project is under development and is not deployed nor testable online._

## 💻 Environment


## 🚀 Installation

_Should work on any Unix system, yet I tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS only._

1. **Prerequisites**

     [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) _(v.16.x.x LTS)_ to run the local Javascript server, execute frontend and backend commands and install packages via the Node Package Manager (NPM).
     
     [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to clone this Git repository and control versioning.
     
     ```shell
     # to check if Node is installed
    node --version # expected : v.16.x.x
    
    # to check if Git is installed
    git --version # expected : 2.3
     ```
     
     _You may need to restart your computer or terminal to complete installations._

2. **Gatsby CLI installation**

    Install globally the Gatsby Command Line Interface (CLI) NPM package.    
    
    ```shell
    # install gatsby cli
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    
    # check installation
    gatsby --version # expected : Gatsby CLI version: 4.16.0
    ```
    
_If you get stucked at Node, Git or Gatsby CLI installation, additional help can be found on Gatsby's official tutorial [Part 0 : Set Up Your Development Environnment](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/)._

## 🧐 Roadmap

## 🎓 Ressources

Kick off your project with this blog boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
